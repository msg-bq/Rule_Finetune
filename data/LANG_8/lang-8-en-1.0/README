This README file described the Lang-8 Corpus of Learner English.


INTRODUCTION
============

We scraped correction data of learner English from Lang-8 (http://lang-8.com),
a SNS for language learning. The data was crawled in September 2011.  The
scraping procedure is described in our IJCNLP 2011 paper (Mizumoto et al.,
2011).

We tokenized learners text by Stanford Parser and extracted candidate verb
phrase using algorithm described in "how_to_ext_vp.txt". We divided the data
into training and testing as described in our ACL 2012 paper (Tajiri et al.,
2012).


DATA FORMAT
===========

1. entries.(train|test)
        We used "entries.train" and "entries.test" split, each of which
        contains 100,000 and 1,000 entries, respectively.
        Each line shows information of one sentence, and each entry is
        separated by a blank line.

        /* Description of each column */
        Column            Description
        -------------------------------------------------
        1                 Number of correction
        2                 Serial number
        3                 the URL of the entry
        4                 Sentence number. 0 is the title
        5                 Sentence written by a learner of English
        anything after 6  Corrected Sentences (If exists)

Example:
1       296282  http://lang-8.com/9416/journals/34829   21      I was watching TV while I drank some hot chocolate , yumyumyum !        I was watching TV while drinking some hot chocolate , yumyumyum !

-------------------------------------------

2. tense_asp.(train|test)
        The files shows tense & aspect of each verb phrase, tagged by Stanford
        Parser.

        /* Description of each column */
        Column          Description
        1               Serial number (corresponding to that of entries.(train|test))
        2               Start point of the verb phrase (word offset)
        3               End point of the verb phrase (word offset)
        4               Head word of the verb phrase
        5               Tense & aspect before correction
                        Tense (PST=past, PRS=present, FTR=future, INF=infinitive, -)
                        Perfect (PFT=perfect, PTP=participle, -)
                        Progressive (PRG=progressive, PTP=participle, -)
        6               Tense & aspect after correction
                        (Same as 5)

Example:
296282  2       3       watch   <PST_-_PRG>     <PST_-_PRG>
296282  7       7       drink   <PST_-_->       <-_-_PTP>

3. how_to_ext_vp.txt
        The file describes how to extract candidate verb phrases from a
        sentence.
